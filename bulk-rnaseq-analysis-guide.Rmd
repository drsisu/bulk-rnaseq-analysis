## Introduction

Here, I present a complete bulk RNA-sequencing pipeline, including:

1. Finding and downloading the raw data using SRA tools
2. Mapping FASTQ files using STAR
3. Differential gene analysis using DESeq2
4. Visualizations for Bulk RNA-sequencing

## Obtaining the raw data

## Downloading FASTQ files using SRA toolkit

## Aligning reads using STAR

## Performing Differential Gene Expression Analysis

## Conclusion
